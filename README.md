# Python_Project_for_Data_Engineering
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Python Project for Data Engineering" final peer review assignment. The project focuses on implementing data engineering techniques using Python, including webscraping, API integration, and the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, to process and transform large datasets efficiently.

## Introduction
The "Python Project for Data Engineering" is a final peer review assignment that demonstrates your understanding and application of data engineering concepts using Python. The project incorporates webscraping and API integration to extract data, followed by the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to transform and load the data into a desired format.

## Usage
The project contains a Jupyter Notebook named ETL_Engineer_Peer_Review_Assignment.ipynb that demonstrates the webscraping, API integration, and ETL process for extracting data, transforming it, and loading it into a desired format.

Project Structure
The project follows the following structure:
```
├── ETL_Engineer_Peer_Review_Assignment.ipynb
├── bank_market_cap_1.json
├── bank_market_cap_2.json
├── exchange_rates.csv
└── logfile.txt
```
- ETL_Engineer_Peer_Review_Assignment.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of webscraping, API integration, and the ETL process.
- bank_market_cap_1.json: JSON file containing bank and market cap data.
- bank_market_cap_2.json: JSON file containing additional bank and market cap data.
- exchange_rates.csv: CSV file containing exchange rate data.
- logfile.txt: Text file for logging ETL process information.

You can modify the notebook to adapt it to your specific requirements or add additional functionality.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas (version 1.3.3)
- requests (version 2.26.0)
